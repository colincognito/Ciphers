# Ciphers
A collection of encrypting and decrypting methods of various types of ciphers

## A Brief History
Ciphers have been evolving with communication styles for centuries. From ancient rulers safeguarding military orders to modern encryption securing digital transactions, ciphers have shaped the way information is protected. The use of ciphers dates back to ancient times. One of the earliest known encryption methods is the **Caesar Cipher**, used by Julius Caesar to protect military correspondence. This simple substitution technique shifts letters forward or backward by a fixed amount determined by the cryptologist.

## Cipher Examples
The **Vigen√®re Cipher**, developed in the 16th century, introduced variable shifts based on a keyword, making it significantly harder to break compared to the predictable Caesar Cipher. For centuries, it was considered "indecipherable" until it was finally cracked in the 19th century using frequency analysis.

During World War II, encryption reached new heights with the **Enigma Machine**, used by the German military. British cryptanalysts, led by **Alan Turing**, successfully deciphered Enigma messages, dramatically altering the course of the war. This breakthrough marked a pivotal moment in cryptography and laid the foundation for modern computing and cybersecurity.

Today, encryption has become highly sophisticated, with algorithms like **RSA**, **AES**, and **Elliptic Curve Cryptography** ensuring secure digital communication. These modern ciphers utilize complex mathematical functions and computational power to protect sensitive data across the globe.

## Importance
Ciphers serve as the backbone of cybersecurity, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity of information. Their importance is evident in various fields:

- **Military and Government Security**, where they protect national intelligence and classified communications
- **Personal Privacy**, safeguards personal conversations and transactions from cyber threats
- **Financial Transactions**, secures online banking, credit card details, and e-commerce data
- **Digital Authentication**, enables password protection, biometric security, and secure messaging
- **Data Integrity**, ensures stored and transmitted information remains unaltered

Without strong encryption, sensitive information would be vulnerable to cyberattacks, fraud, and espionage.

## Applications
Ciphers are used in a wide range of applications, including:
- **Secure Messaging Apps** (like WhatsApp and Signal), employing end-to-end encryption. * Note this encryption is useless if you add unauthorized people to your chat
- **Online Banking and E-Commerce**, securing financial data against fraud.
- **Steganography**, hiding encrypted messages within images or audio files.
- **Quantum Cryptography**, a growing field leveraging quantum mechanics for ultra-secure encryption.

As technology advances, so too will cryptographic techniques, ensuring that ciphers remain an essential tool for safeguarding information in the digital era.

This repository contains multiple types of ciphers that will allow the user to either encrypt or decrypt a message that is either entered manually or from a .txt file.
